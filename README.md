# How to run the program
It is necesarry to start the server before running a client. Do this by entering the repository with the server.go - file, then use the 'go run' command

Then you can start launching clients, without issues, by using the same 'go run' command on client.go.

Once the client is up and running, it will ask you to write your username. Once you have chosen your name, press enter

Now the client is a part of the server. A list of commands will be provided in the terminal. You can now choose to write a message or use one of the following commands:

/profile - shows your name and your userID

/quit - leaves the server and the client termninates

/help - shows the list of the possible commands

If you just want to send a message type anything you want in the terminal and press enter.
Now the message will be send to the server distributed to all currently active clients.

In the terminal you will recieve messages for when people join, leave or see the message that they just send. This happens automatically as the server recieves information from clients.

Once you are done, use the aformentioned /quit command to leave and terminate the operation.
